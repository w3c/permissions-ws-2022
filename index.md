# What is the purpose of this workshop?
Existing and novel Web APIs being used in more and more contexts challenge what users can easily deal with. They may have trouble understanding which information is being disclosed to whom and the threats presented by those disclosures. Deciding when and how to seek a user’s permission or when that permission can be inferred or bypassed has been challenging, with different APIs, operating systems, and browsers handling things in different ways. Both web applications and native applications face similar challenges in this space, and both are in scope for this workshop.

The W3C Workshop on Permissions brings together security and privacy experts, UI/UX designers and researchers, browser vendors, OS developers, API authors, web publishers and users. We aim to address the privacy, security and usability challenges involved in controlling access to an increasingly powerful set of capabilities on the Web and other platforms.

# Which topics will be covered?
To keep the scope of this workshop practical, we'd like to encourage conversation about the ways in which user agents can (or cannot) engage users in its decisions about which capabilities to expose to which websites. The proposed scope includes:

- better alignment of permission lifetime/duration with user tasks;
- human-centric grouping/categorization of permissions and applications;
- challenges with novel capabilities;
- scoping of permissions to origins vs. applications, relation to same origin policy;
- UIs and controls;
- integrated permission control surfaces tailored to the capability itself; and
- permission transparency and control.

We aim to share experiences and user studies, leading to common understanding of how to ensure user comprehension and control of powerful capabilities while managing cognitive load.

The workshop will build on the [W3C Workshop on Permissions and User Consent held in 2018](https://www.w3.org/Privacy/permissions-ws-2018/cfp.html).

# How can I participate?

Attendance is free for all invited participants and is open to the public, whether or not W3C members.

The application form asks several questions about your background and ideas; please give these questions serious thought. In addition to the application form, you are encouraged to [submit](#how-can-i-suggest-a-presentation) a position statement and/or presentation topic.

Because the venue has limited space, you must receive an acceptance email to attend. You might wish to defer making non-refundable travel arrangements until you receive an invitation. Be sure to keep an eye on these important dates.

Our aim is to get diverse attendance from a variety of industries and communities, including:

- UI/UX designers and researchers;
- Privacy researchers;
- Regulators / policymakers;
- Privacy advocates; and
- Persons with expertise and/or experience related to accessibility, multilingual requirements, low connectivity environments, and the particular privacy needs of vulnerable individuals or communities

## Remote participation

This will be a hybrid workshop and we will support remote participants. Sessions will be set in Central European Time, however depending on interest we will endeavor to accommodate UTC-5 (Eastern Standard Time).


# How can I suggest a presentation?

This is a workshop, not a conference, and any presentations will be short, with topics suggested by submissions and decided by the chairs and program committee. Our goal is to actively discuss topics, not to watch presentations.

In order to best facilitate informed discussion, we encourage attendees to read the accepted topics prior to attending the workshop.

If you wish to present on a topic, you should submit a position statement by the deadline (see important dates). Our program committee will review the input provided, and select the most relevant topics and perspectives.

A good position statement should be a few paragraphs long and should include:

- Your background in the main topic areas of the workshop.
- Which topic you would like to lead discussion on.
- Links to related supporting resources.
- Any other topics you think the workshop should cover in order to be effective.
- A focus on technical issues, not process or platform preference. We plan to talk about the what, not the how.
- Position statements must be in English, preferably in HTML or plain-text format. You may include multiple topics, but we ask that each person submit only a single coherent position statement. The input provided at registration time (e.g., bio, goals, interests) will be published and linked to from this workshop page.

Submissions should be between 200 and 1000 words.

Please email statements to the program committee at [permissions-ws-2022-organizers@chromium.org](mailto:permissions-ws-2022-organizers@chromium.org).
